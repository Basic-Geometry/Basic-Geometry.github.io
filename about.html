<h1 style="font-size:160%;margin:7px;">About the Core Geometric System ™</h1>
<br>
<br>
<section><p style="margin:12px;">Once around 2018 I was wondering how to calculate the area of a circle. 
<br>
<br>
I remembered the number 3.14 called the π, but I was interested in the logic of comparing the circle to a square. 
Because the square is the basis of area calculation. That is why we use square units. 
<br>
<br>
The only problem with that was that the circle is not square. I have figured that the circle can be cut into four and then I get four right angles that can be aligned with the vertices of a square.
<br>
<br>
There was a different problem with that: The quadrant circles overlap at some places but the middle of the square is uncovered.
<br>
<br>
I was trying to match the overlapping area with the uncovered by eye. 
<br>
When it looked quite close I did all kinds of complicated calculations.
<br>
I didn't have a routine in that and I wanted to calculate all aspects of it. 
<br>
I calculated quite intensively and my calculations were quite extensive and a backcheck resulted in an error so I got pretty tired and just layed the figure face down.
<br>
<br>
About a month later I had a look at it and I realized at the first glance that the area of the circle equals the area of the square when the arcs of the qudrant circles intersect at the quarters of the centerlines.
<br>
<br>
Maybe that doesn't sound very scientific at first, but somehow I instantly realized that it is the only way.
<br>
<br>
Then I worked out the relationship between the radius and the side of the square algebraically via the Pythagorean theorem.
</p>

<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">
The result is that the area of a circle is exactly 3.2radius².
<br>
<br>
That got me excited for obvious reasons, but also confused. Nobody thought of that before? Why is the π so different?
<br>
<br>
For a long time I just kept thinking and calculating all aspects of that, and I just shared my finding with friends about a year later. But they didn't share my excitement. 
<br>
Some of them didn't really care about math at all, those who did were sticking to the π, just because it's an old and highly hyped convention.
</p>
</section>
<br>
<br>
<section><p style="margin:12px;">
I got curious about the properties of other shapes, and I figured that the volume of a sphere equals the cubed value of the square root of its cross-sectional area, just like a cube.
<br>
<br>
With the limited resources that I had, I conducted some experiments. 
<br>
<br>
These included a ping-pong ball, a golf ball and a vodka bottle that I found somewhere. 
<br>
<br>
I have derived the volume of a cone by comparing a vertical quadrant of a cone to an octant of a sphere.
<br>
I made a mistake in that first 
<br>
</p>
</section>
<br>
<br>
<section><p style="margin:12px;">In 2020 there were news about that online education will be introduced because of the pandemic.
<br>
I thought my discoveries can be useful for others, too, so I shared them online.
<br>
<br>
That was another challenge because I didn't have a routine in that either.
