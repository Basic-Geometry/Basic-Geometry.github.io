Key Points

- Comparative Geometry: Using geometric relationships to derive areas and volumes.
- Scaling and Proportions: Applying proportional relationships for accurate calculations.
- Algebraic Manipulation: Simplifying equations to ensure consistency and precision.
- Exact instead of Approximate Values: Prioritizing the use of simpler constants for practicality while maintaining exact values for accuracy.

1. Area of a Circle:
   - Compared to a square, using geometric properties and the Pythagorean theorem.
   - Formula:  A = 3.2r². 

2. Circumference of a Circle:
   - Derived from the area by subtracting a smaller theoretical circle.
   - Formula:  C = 6.4r. 

3. Volume of a Sphere:
   - Compared to a cube, using the area of the sphere's cross-section.
   - Formula:  V = (√(3.2)r)³. 

4. Volume of a Cone:
   - Compared to an octant sphere and a quarter cylinder.
   - Formula:  V = 3.2r²height/√8.
