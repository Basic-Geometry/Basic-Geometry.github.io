The constant relationship between a circle's circumference and its diameter has captivated mathematicians for millennia. While its approximate value of 3.14159…, commonly denoted by the Greek letter π, is widely recognized today, the historical development of this concept is less understood.
Ancient civilizations grappled with this geometric challenge, employing various methods to approximate this ratio. 
A Greek mathematician is credited with refining these approximations through the method of in- and circumscribed polygons.
His approach was that the ratio between the perimeter and the diameter of a circle can be estimated by comparing the circumference of the circle to the perimeters of an in- and a circumscribed polygon. The polygons can be divided into triangles. The ratio between the triangles' legs and their hypotenuses can be measured linearly.
That's where the pi/delta=3.14... denotation might originate from.
This method has several limitations. He tried to increase the accuracy by increasing the number of the sides of the polygons. This approach cannot yield an accurate result. 
The same coefficient was used to calculate the ratio between the squared radius and the area of a circle.
Despite these early advancements, a precise, universally accepted value for this constant remained elusive for centuries. 
With its value believed to be an infinite fraction, it seemed necessary to denote it with a sign in equations.
It wasn’t until the 18th century that the symbol π, popularized by the mathematicians of the time gained widespread acceptance.
Several complex formulas were introduced by different mathematicians, aiming to more accurately estimate this ratio, based on a theoretical polygon with an infinite number of sides. 
All the above mentioned comparison methods have one thing in common. They are estimating the perimeters of polygons and do not account for the curved shape of the circle. 


The area of a circle is defined by comparing it to a square, as that’s the base of area calculation.

The circle is cut to 4 quadrants, each placed with their origin on the vertices of a square.

When the arcs of the quadrant circles intersect at the quarter of the centerline of the square, the uncovered area in the middle equals exactly the sum of the overlapping areas respectively. 

The area of both the square and the sum of the quadrants equals 16 right triangles with legs of a quarter and a half of the square's sides, and its hypotenuse equal to the radius of the circle. 

The ratio between the radius of the circle and the side of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

r²=(a/4)²+(2(a/4))²
r=(√5)(a/4)
A=(16/5)r²=3.2r²

(√3.2)²÷4−((90−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360×3.2+2(√3.2(1÷4×1÷2)÷2))=
=2(Atan(1÷2)÷360×3.2−√3.2(1÷4×1÷2)÷2)


Simplifying the original equation:

1÷4−((90−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360+(1÷8))=
=2(Atan(1÷2)÷360−(1÷8)÷2)


Simplifying further:

1÷4−((90−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360)=2×Atan(1÷2)÷360


Substituting 90° for 1/4:

|90−((90−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360)|=2×Atan(1÷2)÷360


Simplifying further:

Atan(1÷2) = Atan(1÷2)


Which is equivalent to:

1 = 1

This makes the area of the square exactly equal to the sum of the quadrants.

There are no records available on if this approach has been studied before.

Using the same model, in which we were able to find a direct relationship between the radius of the circle and the side length of the square by ensuring that the overlaps equal the unfilled space, and the radius of the circle equals √((side/4)²+(side/2)²)=√5*side/4, I change the side length of the square to √π, assuming that the area of a circle equals πr². 

The idea is that the area of the circle equals the area of the square. Looking for the ratio between the length of the side, I could denote the side of the square as 1, and compare the radius to that, or denote the radius as 1 and express the side compared to that. 

I denoted the radius as 1 and the side as √π (√(π*1²)). It's a logical necessity if the “A=πr²” formula was right. The side length of the square that has the same area as the circle is √(area of the circle). 

I swap 3.2 for π in the overlap/unfilled equations.

π−((90−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360×π+2(√π(1÷4×1÷2)÷2))=
8(Atan(1÷2)÷360×π−√π(1÷4×1÷2)÷2) 

The equation holds true, meaning that the overlaps cancel out the unfilled area, so the area of the circle equals the area of the square with side=r√π. 
But the square consists of 16 right triangles with legs of side/4 and side/2 and hypotenuse of √5√π÷4~0.991, which equals the radius.
This means that the radius is shorter than it should logically be -one-. 

That's a logical error in the "A=πr²" formula; not the model.

π is an approximation; 3.2 is an exact value.


The area of a circle segment can be calculated by subtracting a triangle from a circle slice.
A=acos((r-n)/r)r²-sin(acos((r-n)/r))(r-n)r


The circumference of a circle is derived algebraically from its area by subtracting a theoretical circle, with radius shorter than the radius of the actual circle by the theoretical width of the circumference.

'x' represents the width of the circumference, which is just theoretical, hence a very small number.

C=(3.2r²-3.2(r-x)²)/x=6.4r-3.2x

As x is close to 0, C=6.4r


The volume of a cylinder equals the area of its base multiplied by its height.
V=3.2r²height


The volume of a sphere is defined by comparing it to a cube, as that's the base of volume calculation.

Just as the volume of a cube equals the square root of its cross section cubed - V=(√(A))³ -,
so is the volume of a sphere equal to the area of its cross section cubed.

The edge length of the cube, which has the same volume as the sphere, equals the square root of the area of the square that has the same area as the sphere's cross section.

V=(√(3.2)r)³


Volume of a spherical cap:
V=1.6(r(cap))²(√3.2)(1-sin(acos(r(cap)/r(sphere))))


The volume of a cone can be calculated by algebraically comparing the volume of a quarter cone with equal radius and height to an octant sphere with equal radius, through a quarter cylinder.

V(octant sphere)=(√(3.2)r/2)³=

=(√(3.2)r/2)(√(3.2)r/2)(√(3.2)r/2)

The base of the two shapes is a quarter circle.

A(base)=(√(3.2)r/2)²=(√(3.2)r/2)(√(3.2)r/2)

The slant height of the quarter cone is √(2)r.
The volume of a quarter cylinder with the same base, and height equal to the slant height of the cone would be (√(3.2)r/2)²(√(2)r). 

The slant shape comes with a triangular vertical cross section. 
The area of a cone's vertical cross section is the half of a cylinder with equal base and height. 

The intermediate of the areas of the horizontal cross-section slices of a cone is the half of a cylinder’s.

V(quarter cone)=(√(3.2)r/2)²height(√(2)/4)=
=(1/5)r²height√2

V(cone)=3.2radius²height/√8


Volume of a frustum cone:
V=H(√2/4)(b²(4/5)(1/(1-t/b))-t²(4/5)(1/(1-t/b)-1))
(b=bottom diameter; t=top diameter)


Surface area of a cone:
A=A(bottom)+A(side)=3.2(r²+(r²+h²)(r/√(r²+h²)))


The volume of a pyramid is derived from the volume of a cone as V=(area of base)height√2/4.


That makes the volume of a tetrahedron V=((√3/4)edge²)(√(2/3)edge)√2/4= (√2/4)edge³√2/4= edge³(√2/4)²= edge³2/16= edge³/8.


Volume of a frustum pyramid:
V=H(√2/4)(b²(1/(1-t/b))-t²(1/(1-t/b)-1))
(b=bottom edge; t=top edge)
